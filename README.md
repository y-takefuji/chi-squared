# chi-squared vs. feature importances

The Chi-squared test and p-value can generate true associations between y and x1, y and x2, …, and y and xn, where y=f(x1,x2,x3,...,xn).

Feature importances in machine learning are not true associations due to inherent biases. Feature importances in machine learning models, such as those derived from decision trees or random forests, can be misleading when interpreted as true associations between the target and features. This is because feature importance measures how much a feature contributes to the model’s predictions, but it doesn’t imply a causal relationship. A feature might be important due to its correlation with the target, but this doesn’t mean it causes the target. Additionally, when features are highly correlated with each other (multicollinearity), the importance of individual features can be distorted, leading to an inaccurate reflection of their true relationship with the target. Feature importances are also model-specific; different models have different ways of calculating feature importance, which can lead to varying interpretations. For example, in linear models, importance is based on the magnitude of coefficients, while in tree-based models, it might be based on the reduction in impurity. Overfitting can further complicate matters, as feature importances might reflect noise rather than true associations. Lastly, feature importance measures often do not account for interactions between features, meaning a feature might appear unimportant on its own but could be crucial when combined with other features.
